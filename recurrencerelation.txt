Iterative:

In my iterative function, each array element is compared to half of the array, meaning T(n) = O(n/2)

Recursive:

In my recursive function, each element is compared n/2 + n/4 + n/8 ... + n/2^i where i is the number of subdivisions.
The summation of these comparisons is simply n, so T(n) = O(n)
