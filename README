Contains a Makefile, iterative  (iterattive.cc) and recursive ((recursive.cc) scripts to find the minimum and maximum of an integer array, and a helper method (helper.h)

iterave.cc: Splits the array into two halves, traverses each half to find the minimum and maximum value of each, and then compares these values to get the overall extremes.

recursive.cc: Recursively iterates over halves of the passed array, storing the min and max throug use of a minMax object

helper.h: Contains a minMax structure that has fields for a 'minimum' and 'maximum' (int,int)


INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE:
make it (compile iterative) OR make re (compile recursive)
./iterative OR ./recursive

TIME COMPLEXITY REPORT:

Iterative:

In my iterative function, each array element is compared to half of the array, meaning T(n) = O(n/2)

Recursive:

In my recursive function, each element is compared n/2 + n/4 + n/8 ... + n/2^i where i is the number of subdivisions.
The summation of these comparisons is simply n, so T(n) = O(n)
